abstract  = "In this paper we describe an approach for the parameterization and modeling of objects represented by adaptive distance fields (ADFs). ADF's allow the construction of powerful solid modeling tools. They can represent surfaces of arbitrary and even changing topology, while providing a more intuitive modeling interface than control point based structures such as splines. Using the octree structure of ADFs, we build an adaptively refined quadrilateral mesh that is topologically equivalent to the object's surface. We then project the mesh onto the object using multiple projection and smoothing steps. The resulting mesh serves as the user interface for modeling iperations and is used for high quality rendering of the resulting shape.",
